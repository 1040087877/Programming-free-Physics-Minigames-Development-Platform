# Interflowing Physics Minigames Design and Display Platform
## Basically no further changes after July 2017

This project is programmed in 'Processing', an open-source graphical library and integrated development environment built for visual design. Was only for fun, but also won several national and provincial prizes.

### Design purpose
In the field of computer games, light creative physics games are the most distinctive, like the Flappy Bird and Fruit Ninja. Such kind of games have very low development costs, but usually with significant creativity and playability. If this characteristic can be rationally used, then it can create an extremely reasonable profit. However, the flashpoints of people's favour are very hard to catch. Hence, is there a possibility to implement people's ideas more efficiently and smoothly, then dominated by the quantity of it?

It is also crucial to diminish the gap between people and technology -- not everyone has the whole set of abilities to make ideas true, not only programming but also art design as well as audio production. For solving this common demand, a set of solutions were proposed which can meet the needs of human-computer interaction. Using this technology demo, users can use no matter what device at no matter which places, and quickly express their ideas for physics minigames and directly export the reproducible prototype products without entering any single line of code. People can record their inspiration and ideas only like making pictures on the 'MSPaint', which is feasible for all ages.

The project as a complete software ecosystem is divided into three following modules:

### First module: 'Cavans'(Done) --- 
by using it you can draw everything you want very conveniently, even the logical relationship.

### Second module: 'Code generator'(Done) --- 
by using it you can directly get the industrial-level code which has been implemented while you are drawing things on 'Cavans', and can be used by professionals for agile development

### Third module: 'Ideas Centre'(Undone) --- 
by having it users can create and release their creative designs and projects at this website(also platform), and others can play, social, clone, modify and pull requests just like people are doing here in GitHub. It also allows users to share and exchange ideas, organise teamwork, or even make money by the clicks of advertisement which is attached to their project.
