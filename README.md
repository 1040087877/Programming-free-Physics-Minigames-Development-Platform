# Interflowing Physics Minigames Design and Display Platform
## Basically no further changes after July 2017

This project is programmed by 'Processing', the graphic library based on Java. 
For more information, you can watch the display video.

In the field of computer games, light creative physics games are the most distinctive, like the Flappy Bird and Fruit Ninja. Such kind of games have very low development costs, but usually with significant creativity and playability. If this characteristic can be rationally used, then it can create an extremely reasonable profit. However, the flashpoints of people's favour are very hard to catch. Hence, is there a possibility to implement people's ideas more efficiently and smoothly, then dominated by the quantity of it?

It is also crucial to diminish the gap between people and technology -- not everyone has the whole set of abilities to make ideas true, not only programming but also art design as well as audio production. 

### First module: 'Cavans'(Done) -- you can draw everything you want on it very conveniently, even the logical relationship.
For solving this common demand, a set of solutions were proposed which can meet the needs of human-computer interaction. Using this technology demo, users can use no matter what device at no matter which places, and quickly express their ideas for physics minigames and directly export the reproducible prototype products without entering any single line of code. People can record their inspiration and ideas only like making pictures on the 'MSPaint', which is feasible for all ages.

### Second module: 'Code generator'(Done) -- you can directly get the perfect code which has been implemented on bottom-level while you are drawing things on 'Cavans.'

Besides, it can generate source codes in 'Processing' simultaneously while drawing things on the canvas, which can be used by professionals for agile development.

### Third module: 'Ideas Centre'(Undone) -- users can create and release their projects at this website(platform), and others can play, social, clone, modify and pull requests like people are doing here on the GitHub.
It can also be the aggregation and presentation platform for creative designs, which allow users to share ideas, exchange ideas, organise and release tasks, or even make money by the clicks of advertisement which is attached to their project.
