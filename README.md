# Interflowing创意设计聚合呈现平台

In the field of computer games, light creative physics games are the most distinctive, such as the Flappy Bird, Fruit Ninja, and so on. Such games have very low development costs, but usually with significant creativity and playability. If this characteristic can be rationally used, then it can create an extremely reasonable profit.
Hence, is there a possibility to implement people's ideas more efficiently. Besides, it is crucial to diminish the gap between people and technology -- not everyone has the programming ability to make ideas true.
For solving this common demand, I proposed a set of solutions which can meet the needs of human-computer interaction.
Using this technology demo, users can use no matter what device at no matter which places, to quickly express their ideas for light physical games and directly make prototype products without entering any single line of code. It can also be the aggregation and presentation platform for creative designs, which allow users to share ideas, exchange ideas, and release tasks.

It is developed based on the 'Processing' graphic library, programmed in Java.
